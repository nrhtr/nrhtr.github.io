      <description>&lt;p&gt;Urbit is the most ambitious software project you&amp;rsquo;ve probably never heard of. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s anything else in computing that even comes close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urbit is a re-imagining of what computing could look like if you had a decentralised, encrypted, peer-to-peer network underlying everything. It&amp;rsquo;s what the Internet wanted to be when it grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Urbit is a virtual cloud computer that you control forever. Here are just a few reasons why Urbit is so awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I decided to finally do something with this domain I&amp;rsquo;ve owned for&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many years, it seemed to make sense to turn it into a blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you all know, the most important part of starting a blog is picking which tech stack you&amp;rsquo;re going to use. I had heard of Jekyll but after some Googling I quickly stumbled across Hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Go which automatically makes it 10x cooler. I&amp;rsquo;m sure somebody even cooler has rewritten it in Rust by now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
